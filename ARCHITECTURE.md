# Blockchain-based Secure Voting App: Systems Design Outline

## 1. Architecture Overview
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API
- Blockchain Integration: Python with web3.py library
- Database: SQL Server for user management and non-blockchain data

## 2. Components

### a. Frontend (React.js)
- User registration and authentication
- Ballot viewing and casting interface
- Real-time vote counting and results display

### b. Backend (ASP.NET Core)
- RESTful API for user management
- Integration with blockchain through Python scripts
- Vote validation and processing

### c. Blockchain Layer (Ethereum-based)
- Smart contracts for vote storage and tallying
- Integration with backend using web3.py

### d. Database
- Store user information and authentication data
- Keep track of voting events and participation

## 3. Key APIs and Libraries

### a. Blockchain Integration
- Web3.py: Python library for interacting with Ethereum
- Nethereum: .NET integration library for Ethereum

### b. Backend
- ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication
- Entity Framework Core for database operations

### c. Frontend
- Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests to backend
- Web3.js for direct blockchain interactions (if needed)

## 4. Data Flow
1. User registers and authenticates through the React frontend
2. Backend validates user and provides access token
3. User requests ballot from backend
4. Backend fetches ballot info from blockchain and sends to frontend
5. User casts vote through frontend
6. Backend receives vote, validates it, and sends to blockchain
7. Blockchain smart contract processes and stores the vote
8. Results are fetched from blockchain and displayed in real-time

## 5. Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Use encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Ensure proper smart contract auditing and testing

## 6. Scalability
- Use load balancers for backend services
- Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequent blockchain queries
- Consider sidechains or Layer 2 solutions for improved blockchain scalability

## 7. Key APIs for Blockchain Voting System

### 1. Web3.py (Python)
- `web3.eth.contract`: To interact with smart contracts
- `web3.eth.account`: For managing Ethereum accounts and signing transactions

### 2. Nethereum (.NET)
- `Nethereum.Web3`: For connecting to Ethereum nodes
- `Nethereum.Contracts`: To interact with smart contracts from C#

### 3. ASP.NET Core Web API
- Create custom API endpoints for user registration, authentication, and vote casting

### 4. Ethereum JSON-RPC API
- Use this API through Web3.py or Nethereum to interact with the Ethereum network

### 5. IPFS API (optional)
- If you decide to store larger datasets off-chain, IPFS could be used for decentralized storage
