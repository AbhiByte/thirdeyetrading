# Third Eye Trading
A highly experimental HFT system based on [global conciousness](https://noosphere.princeton.edu/)

The project aims to develop a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system that uses Rust and C# .NET, integrating data from the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) as an innovative signal for executing trades. The system will analyze deviations in random number generators (RNGs) from the GCP and correlate them with market movements to make informed trading decisions.
